                 <h2>Colorism is a  practice of discrimination by which those with lighter skin are treated more favorably than those with darker skin. This practice is a product of racism in the United States, in that it upholds the white standards of beauty and benefits white people in the institutions of oppression (media, medical world, etc.) Note that while the definition above highlight the United States, the famous African American author and feminist , Alice Walker notes that   “colorism”—is a global cultural practice.”  According to Walker, colorism emerges throughout European colonial and imperial history, colorism is prevalent in countries as distant as Brazil and India. Its legacy is evident in forums as public as the television and movie industries.
